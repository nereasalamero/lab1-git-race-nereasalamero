```

**Bad Examples**:
```
fix
updates
changes
```

#### Commit History Best Practices
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Frequent Commits**: Commit often with small, focused changes
- **Clean History**: Use `git rebase` to clean up your commit history before pushing
- **Feature Branches**: Create branches for new features: `git checkout -b feature/user-authentication`

#### Branching Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial feature implementation"

# Clean up history if needed
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Avoiding Common Mistakes
- **No Large Commits**: Don't commit everything at once
- **No Merge Commits**: Use rebase instead of merge when possible
- **No Commit Messages Like "fix"**: Always be descriptive
- **No Committing Build Files**: Use `.gitignore` properly
